The
Trump
administration
is
expected
on
Wednesday
to
formally
revoke
California’s
authority
to
set
auto
emissions
rules
that
are
stricter
than
federal
standards,
taking
a
major
step
forward
in
its
wide-ranging
attack
on
government
efforts
to
fight
climate
change.
The
formal
abolishment
of
one
of
California’s
signature
environmental
policies
—
tailpipe
pollution
is
the
largest
source
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
in
the
United
States
—
will
be
announced
Wednesday
afternoon
at
the
Washington
headquarters
of
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency,
according
to
two
people
familiar
with
the
matter.
